# Documentation Overview

This directory contains various design and specification documents for the jQAssistant-based GraphRAG project. These documents aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the system's architecture, core components, and specific design decisions.

## High-Level Design Documents

These documents provide an overview of the system's architecture and key design principles.

-   **[Enriching jQAssistant Graph for GraphRAG](designing-jqassistant-graph-for-graphrag.md)**: Details the design of the graph processing pipeline, focusing on how the raw jQAssistant graph is normalized, enriched, and linked to source files to prepare it for RAG.
-   **[Designing for Modular Scalable Summarization](designing-for-modular-scalable-summarization.md)**: Explores the design principles and architecture behind the modular and scalable summarization pipeline, including how LLMs are leveraged and context is managed.
-   **[Specification of the jQAssistant-based Graph Architecture](spec-jqassistant-graph-architecture.md)**: Provides a detailed specification of the Neo4j graph generated by jQAssistant and the semantic layer built on top of it, including node labels, relationships, and custom properties.

## Detailed Component Design Documents

This subdirectory contains detailed design specifications for the core components of the jQAssistant-based GraphRAG system. Each document describes a component's purpose, workflow, key methods, dependencies, and design rationale.

-   **[000-architecture-design-of-jqassistant-graphrag.md](design-documents/000-architecture-design-of-jqassistant-graphrag.md)**: Provides a high-level architectural overview of the entire jQAssistant-based GraphRAG system, including its phases and major components.
-   **[010-project-core-components.md](design-documents/010-project-core-components.md)**: Lists and briefly describes the most important components of the project, serving as an index to the more detailed design documents.
-   **[020-graph-orchestrator.md](design-documents/020-graph-orchestrator.md)**: Design document for the `GraphOrchestrator`, which coordinates the initial graph normalization and enrichment.
-   **[030-rag-orchestrator.md](design-documents/030-rag-orchestrator.md)**: Design document for the `RagOrchestrator`, which manages the entire summary and embedding generation pipeline.
-   **[040-node-summary-processor.md](design-documents/040-node-summary-processor.md)**: Design document for the `NodeSummaryProcessor`, the core logic for processing individual nodes for summarization.
-   **[050-base-summarizer.md](design-documents/050-base-summarizer.md)**: Design document for the `BaseSummarizer` abstract class, which provides a reusable framework for all summarization passes.
-   **[060-summary-cache-manager.md](design-documents/060-summary-cache-manager.md)**: Design document for the `SummaryCacheManager`, responsible for managing the on-disk cache for summaries and content hashes.
-   **[070-graph-normalizer.md](design-documents/070-graph-normalizer.md)**: Design document for the `GraphNormalizer`, which executes crucial passes to create stable IDs, absolute paths, and a clean graph hierarchy.
-   **[080-source-file-linker.md](design-documents/080-source-file-linker.md)**: Design document for the `SourceFileLinker`, which links graph nodes to their corresponding source files.
-   **[090-entity-embedder.md](design-documents/090-entity-embedder.md)**: Design document for the `EntityEmbedder`, which generates vector embeddings and creates the searchable index in Neo4j.
-   **[100-token-manager.md](design-documents/100-token-manager.md)**: Design document for the `TokenManager`, which handles token counting and context window management for LLMs.
