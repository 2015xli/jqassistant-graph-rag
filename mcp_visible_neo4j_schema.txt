## Node Properties:
  (:Project) 
    //There is only one :Project node as the root entry of the whole graph. It connects source tree through [:CONTAINs_SOURCE] relationship, and connects package/class tree through [:CONTAINS_CLASS] relationshp.
    entity_id: STRING (UNIQUE)
    name: STRING
    absolute_path: STRING
    summary: STRING
    summaryEmbedding: LIST

  (:Directory)
    //Nodes for the source tree directories. Directory nodes connect their sub-directory/file nodes through [:CONTAINS_SOURCE] nodes.
    entity_id: STRING (UNIQUE)
    absolute_path: STRING
    summary: STRING
    summaryEmbedding: LIST

  (:SourceFile)
    //Nodes for the source files in Java/Kotlin
    entity_id: STRING (UNIQUE)
    absolute_path: STRING
    summary: STRING
    summaryEmbedding: LIST

  (:ClassTree)
    //Nodes for the roots of package/class trees. One project may have multiple package/class trees, e.g., for different jars. :ClassTree nodes connect their sub-package/class tree nodes through [:CONTAINS_CLASS] relationship.
    entity_id: STRING (UNIQUE)
    absolute_path: STRING
    summary: STRING
    summaryEmbedding: LIST

  (:Package)
    //Nodes for the packages under a ClassTree. Package nodes connect their sub-package/class nodes through [:CONTAINS_CLASS] relationship.
    entity_id: STRING (UNIQUE)
    fqn: STRING
    summary: STRING
    summaryEmbedding: LIST

  (:Class | :Interface | :Enum)
    //Nodes under packages. They all have :Type label. They connect with their :Member nodes (:Method, :Field) through [:DECLARES] relationship, and connect their source file through [:WITH_SOURCE] relationship.
    entity_id: STRING (UNIQUE)
    fqn: STRING
    summary: STRING
    summaryEmbedding: LIST

  (:Type)
    //Nodes of :Class, :Interface, :Enum have also :Type label. They extends/implements other :Types with [:EXTENDS] and [:IMPLEMENTS] relationships.

  (:Method)
    //Nodes of :Type's member methods. They connect their callee methods through [:INVOKES] relationship, and connect their source file through [:WITH_SOURCE] relationship.
    entity_id: STRING (UNIQUE)
    name: STRING
    signature: STRING
    summary: STRING
    summaryEmbedding: LIST

  (:Field)
    //Nodes of :Type's member fields. They connect their source file through [:WITH_SOURCE] relationship.
    entity_id: STRING (UNIQUE)
    name: STRING
    signature: STRING
    summary: STRING

  (:Member)
    :Method and :Field nodes have also :Member label

## Relationships:

  (:ClassTree) -[:CONTAINS_CLASS]-> (:Package)
  (:Package) -[:CONTAINS_CLASS]-> (:Package)
  (:Package) -[:CONTAINS_CLASS]-> (:Class | :Interface | :Enum)

  (:Class | :Interface | :Enum) -[:DECLARES]-> (:Method | :Field)
  (:Class | :Interface) -[:EXTENDS]-> (:Class | :Interface)

  (:Method) -[:INVOKES]-> (:Method)

  (:Class | :Interface | :Enum) -[:WITH_SOURCE]-> (:SourceFile)

## Condensed form of Relationships:

  (:Directory) -[:CONTAINS_SOURCE]-> (:Directory | :SourceFile)
  (:Project) -[:CONTAINS_CLASS]-> (:ClassTree)
  (:ClassTree | :Package) -[:CONTAINS_CLASS]-> (:Package | :Type)

  (:Method) -[:INVOKES]-> (:Method)
  (:Type | :Member) -[:WITH_SOURCE]-> (:SourceFile)

## Property Explanations:
  entity_id: A stable, globally unique identifier for the node. 
  absolute_path: The full, unambiguous path to a file or directory on the filesystem. Use this for reading file contents.
  fqn: The Fully Qualified Name for a package or type (e.g., "java.util.List"). Use this to query for specific packages or classes.
  signature: The unique signature of a method or field within its declaring type.
  summary: A summary of the node's purpose and role.  
  summaryEmbedding: A vector embedding of the 'summary' property, used for semantic similarity searches.
